The {item}Emerald Wand of Iridescence{} (and its more elusive {concept}Sapphire{} counterpart), are of interest when it
comes to {concept}connecting networked machinery{}.


Specifically, it is capable of {concept}binding together{} and {concept}releasing{} (sneak-use to cycle) individual blocks to
form networks like those employed to create, transport and process [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux).

To do this, {concept}use the wand on two blocks in succession{} to either create or release the link between them.


If you need to join multiple blocks to the same hub, {concept}right-click the wand in your inventory{} to make it
remember the initial block.
