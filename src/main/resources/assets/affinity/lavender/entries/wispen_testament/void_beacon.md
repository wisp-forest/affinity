After once again dying and losing all your belongings to the void, you decide to devise a countermeasure.


Driven by the immense power of the {item}Dragon Drop{} operating in harmony with the far-reaching effects of a 
{item}Beacon{}, the {item}Void Beacon{} {concept}returns players from the void{} while operating.

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/void_beacon>

After some more investigation, it appears that an area {concept}reaching 24 chunks into every cardinal direction{} is
covered by the beacon's protective influence.

;;;;;

As expected from such a mighty device, {concept}half of its charge is depleted{} every time it activates. 


Furthermore, a trait inherited from its beacon ancestor, a supporting platform of {item}Amethyst Blocks{} 
used for storing and conducting aethum flux *and* direct view of the void is required.


When configured correctly, the beacon establishes

a beam anchoring it straight into the void - ready to operate.
