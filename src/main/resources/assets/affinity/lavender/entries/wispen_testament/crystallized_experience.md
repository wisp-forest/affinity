A common nuisance to the enchantment aficionado is the rather greedy nature with which {concept}Experience Levels{} are
consumed in contrast to the laborious nature of acquiring them.


One day, trying to mix up some {item}Lapis Lazuli{}-colored rock candy, you accidentally create the first
{item}Budding Experience Crystal{}.

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/budding_experience_crystal>

This scrumptious confection {concept}absorbs 30 levels worth of experience{} when consumed,
leaving behind some sugary {item}Crystallized Experience{}.


@next-page

Consuming this clump once more {concept}restores 30 levels worth of experience{} - precisely the amount it took to create
it in the first place.

---

Importantly, this process {concept}absorbs experience fairly{} - disregarding the usual, greedy consumption rates.


As an example, it only takes {concept}about 40 levels{} to create {concept}two{} {item}Crystallized Experience{},

;;;;;

which can both {concept}bring the consumer from 0 to 30 levels{}.


This allows much more economical use of the experience built up over time than simply surrendering to the
enchanting devices' extortion.
