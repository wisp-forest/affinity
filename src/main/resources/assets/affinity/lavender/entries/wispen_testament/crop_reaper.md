To the venerable farmer, the {item}Crop Reaper{} brings either joy or terror, depending on perspective.


Driven by the destructive forces of the integrated [Vicious Wisp Matter](^affinity:wisps), it {concept}harvests
fully-grown crops{} in its immediate vicinity and {concept}directly transmutes the yield into{}
[Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux).

Conveniently, it also {concept}replants what it broke{}, making it easy to let it run perpetually.


To examine the area in which it harvests, employ the [Wand of Inquiry](^affinity:inquiry#3).
