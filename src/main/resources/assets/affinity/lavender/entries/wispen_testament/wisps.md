Found swarming the vast expanses of the [Wisp Forests](^affinity:wisp_forest) and the former's namesake, the
{concept}Wisps{} are a curious species. Born of [Aethum](^affinity:aethum), they exhibit only mostly-physical form
and an innate affinity for all things magical.


Though only obtained through cruel means, their essence - {item}Wisp Matter{} - possesses the most riveting magical
properties and thus serves

;;;;;

as a crucial ingredient in a majority of recipes. It goes without saying that to obtain a Wisp's matter, it
{concept}must be slain{}.


Now, over many generations of evolution, the Wisps have separated into {concept}three distinct castes{}, which are to be
discussed on the following pages.


@next-page

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=affinity:inert_wisp_matter|>

The {concept}Inert Wisp{} is the most frequent and least distinguished of the bunch.


They move in small groups all over the [Wisp Forest](^affinity:wisp_forest), not interested in anything and of no
greater interest to anybody either.


As such, their {item}Inert Wisp Matter{} posses no special

;;;;;

properties beyond those common to all {item}Wisp Matter{}.


In spite of, or perhaps, because of, its unremarkable nature, {item}Inert Wisp Matter{} is by far the most frequently
used kind of the three - after all, it is abundantly available and not all applications require the more specialized
qualities of the others.

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=affinity:wise_wisp_matter|>

As implied by their name, the {concept}Wise Wisps{} are the most intelligent inhabitants of the
[Wisp Forest](^affinity:wisp_forest). They move in groups similar in size to the {concept}Inert Wisps{}, but in lower
numbers overall.


Contrary to the others, they love {item}Azalea Flowers{} and will follow anyone who presents them with some. Further,

;;;;;

the {concept}Wise Wisps{} possess knowledge of the [ritual flux-field](^affinity:conducting_rituals) and, when sufficiently
close to a ritual-in-progress, {concept}boost its stability{}.


Their matter is, in a sense, an essence of knowledge and thus proves useful for all applications where some intelligence
or the processing of information is required.


@next-page

<|item-spotlight@lavender:book_components|item=affinity:vicious_wisp_matter|>

Last but not least, the {concept}Vicious Wisps{} are the guards of the [Wisp Forest](^affinity:wisp_forest) and defend
it against any and all intruders.


Compared to their brethren, they patrol in groups much larger yet also significantly further between.

;;;;;

Caution is of the essence when dealing with a pack, as the {concept}Vicious Wisps{} do not fool around.


This unyielding quality of strength, destruction and combat makes the {item}Vicious Wisp Matter{} a formidable material,
immensely useful for the construction of weapons.
