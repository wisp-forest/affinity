Being able to obtain detailed information about all sorts of magical contraptions is indubitably of vital importance.


The {item}Wand of Inquiry{} (in a certain sense not much more than an educated {item}Eye of Ender{} strapped to an
[Uncanny Rod](^affinity:wand_of_iridescence)), thus, is an instrument designed precisely for this purpose.

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/wand_of_inquiry>

The first, essential application of the {item}Wand of Inquiry{} lies in {concept}estimating the stability of a ritual's
flux-field{}. To employ it for...


@next-page

...this purpose, it need only be {concept}used on the core{} of the ritual-under-test. 


Conveniently, it also 
{concept}marks all socles considered in the estimation{}. To limit it to only those socles which hold an item, like
would happen during a ritual, {concept}sneak while interacting{} with the core.

The second, equally if not more relevant, use is {concept}area-of-effect visualization{}. A large range of magical

;;;;;

devices which interact with their surroundings can be inspected this way, marked by {concept}this outline{}...

;;;;;

...when targeted with a {item}Wand of Inquiry{}. In this situation, {concept}punching the block{} with your wand (don't
worry, it won't be mad) entices it to start displaying the outline.

---

The penultimate, arguably most insightful, modus operandi is the {concept}visualization of Aethum Flux networks{}. To
inspect a network, simply {concept}interact with{} any device capable of storing or transferring [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) -
your wand will do the rest.

;;;;;

Finally, there have been some rumors of debatable veracity of the {item}Wand of Inquiry{} {concept}speaking{} to bystanders
and asking {concept}the most ponderous of questions{} - no such incident has ever been confirmed, however.
