The study of {concept}Aethum{}, the energy emanating from and necessary for all manifestations of life, began many
lifetimes ago and continues to this day.


Initially thought to be a mere, inert byproduct of existence, it was soon discovered that by twisting and bending these
very fundamental forces, greatness (along with great evil) could

;;;;;

be accomplished.

Naturally, you (the reader) do indeed also posses an amount of {concept}Aethum{} - tightly coupled to your life. Like
with any other being, if it goes {concept}too low{}, you will {concept}swiftly wither{}. 


This balance (indicated to the right of your crosshair while not at full strength), is {concept}key to the 
functionality...{}

{concept}...of most magical equipment{}. In fact, using such a tool will impact your balance - after which {concept}it 
needs some time to recover{}, to prevent a painful death as outlined previously.


All such items (like the numerous [Staffs](^affinity:staff_prototyping)), have their usage costs {concept}outlined in their tooltip{}.

Now, since the world itself is of course filled with thriving wildlife, there is a

;;;;;

non-negligible amount of {concept}Environmental Aethum{} which varies from area to area. This level is of vital
importance for [rituals](^affinity:conducting_rituals) and a range of other processes.

To study the strength of {concept}Environmental Aethum{} at a given place, the {item}Aethum Map{} (enveloped with 
[Anthracite](^affinity:anthracite_extraction), a material strongly receptive to changes in {concept}Aethum{} density)
should be used.

The prototype thus constructed can be turned into a fully-fledged map at any time.


On said map, bright areas indicate a {concept}strong presence of Environmental Aethum{} and vice-versa for darker ones.

On the above map, both the strongest and weakest naturally occurring levels can be seen.
