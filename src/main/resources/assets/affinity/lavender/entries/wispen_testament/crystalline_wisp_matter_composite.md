Fusing the supplied {item}Diamond{} crystals with all three variants of [Wisp Matter](^affinity:wisps) over a base of
[Scintillant Anthracite Blend](^affinity:scintillant_anthracite_blend) is a rather complex infusion process which
demands a rather large quantity of [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux).


Yet, this is no doubt a worthwhile thing to - the resultant {item}Crystalline Wisp Matter Composite{} exhibits a

range of useful qualities - of which unparalleled [Aethum](^affinity:aethum) conduction is only one. For this reason,
most high-tier recipes makes use of it.
