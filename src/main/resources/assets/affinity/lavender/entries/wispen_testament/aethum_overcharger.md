It appears a rather logical idea to try infusing the {item}Totem of Undying{} with some [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux), seeing
how they both deal with the very essence of life and death.


Indeed, combined with some other common (and less common) items of magical merit and a human sacrifice, the 
{item}Aethum Overcharger{} provides an interesting effect.

When equipped during an otherwise fatal event, it will activate and {concept}temporarily bring the user back from the
brink of death{} in a somewhat incorporeal manner.


To be precise, the user will be {concept}completely invulnerable for 15 seconds{}. After this time passes, however,
death will catch up and the user's timely demise is inevitable.
