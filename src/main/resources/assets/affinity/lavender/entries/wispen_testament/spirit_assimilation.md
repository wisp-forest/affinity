Reinforced by a {concept}Netherite Ingot{} and empowered with [Vicious Wisp Matter](^affinity:wisps#7), the {item}Spirit
Integration Apparatus{} (or more accurately, four of them) is the key to performing a {concept}Spirit Assimilation{}
ritual.


This significantly more sophisticated process fundamentally behaves similarly to the
[Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion) - it infuses a

;;;;;

<recipe;affinity:aspen_infusion/spirit_integration_apparatus>

selection of prime ingredients with the supplemental inputs
provided through a number of [Ritual Socles](^affinity:socle_composition).

;;;;;

In contrast to the [Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion) however (and as hinted by its name and the inclusion of
[Vicious Wisp Matter](^affinity:wisps#7)), the {concept}Spirit Assimilation{} further incorporates some or all features
of a {concept}sacrifice's soul{} - enabling the fabrication of far more powerful magical artifacts.

Needless to say, the sacrificial being {concept}does not survive{} this procedure.


To prepare a {concept}Spirit Assimilation{} setup, 4 {item}Spirit{}

;;;;;

{item}Integration Apparatus{} must be arranged as follows:

<structure-visualizer;affinity:spirit_integration_apparatus>

@next-page

;;;;;

Then, [Ritual Socles](^affinity:socle_composition) shall be arranged around the now-formed ritual core, closely
observing the [familiar rules](^affinity:aspen_infusion#3).

---

Now, to perform a ritual, its prime and supplemental ingredients shall be {concept}placed onto the core and socles{}
according to the recipe in question - just like it is done for the [Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion).
The sacrificial being, itself outlined in the recipe, must then be {concept}lured into{} the

;;;;;

vacant space between the {item}Spirit Integration Apparatus{} (with a little help from a
[Kinesis Staff](^affinity:kinesis_staff), perchance).


With these preparations complete (and the necessary [Aethum Flux](^affinity:aethum_flux) available, spread evenly between
each {item}Spirit Integration Apparatus{}) the procedure is initiated using the same means as the
[Aspen Infusion](^affinity:aspen_infusion#7).
